Steps to install python3 on Windows 10
Navigate to this page on your favorite web browser: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/
Download and execute thhis installer: Windows x86-64 executable installer
Start the installer and select Customize installation. On the next screen leave all the optional features checked. 
Finally, on the Advanced Options screen make sure to check Install for all users
Add Python to environment variables and Precompile standard library
Optionally, you can customize the install location. I’ve used C:\Program Files\

Once installed, feel free to check your paths by opening up a command prompt and typing "python"
	You can open a command prompt by going to windows search (Windows Key) and typing "CMD"

Next download the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Tools from: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53587
Be sure to select the appropriate version, in this case the vc_redist.x86.exe installer.

Visit the following site to find the below wheels: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Next download numpy wheel (whl) for the appropriate version, in this case the numpy‑1.12.1+mkl‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl
After that download the openCV wheel for the approprate version, opencv_python‑3.2.0+contrib‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl
I wasn't sure if we needed the contrib version but I chose it just in case.

After both of the wheels have finished downloading we need to install them using pip.
Open an ADMINISTRATOR Command Prompt and navigate to your downloads directory. (cd \Users\youraccount\Downloads)

Then first run
pip install numpy‑1.12.1+mkl‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl

After it completes run
pip install opencv_python‑3.2.0+contrib‑cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl

Restart the command prompt and you should have opencv3 and python3 running on your windows machine!
